Kid VM is a web application to help manage/track your children's allowances. You are able to setup allowances for your children that occur in a specified frequency. This will automatically be added as a transaction for your child, so you don't have to worry about that. Then when ever there is a transaction you can record it and thus maintain the correct balance that your child has saved so far.
